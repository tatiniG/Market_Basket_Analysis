* The most common and difficult task to deal. Increase the number of competitors, economy, seazonal issues and a lot of others features that influence in this market.

* Thinking about that Machine Learning can help to understand the customer behavior and analyze the sales history to make predictions to boost the sales.

I have focused on keeping top 9 best-selling products and products with longer lifespan. Items that have shorter lifespan will be discounted after rush hours at 5 p.m.

I will evaluate and generate new marketing plan to attract more segments of customers. One possible marketing strategy is to implement first-time customer program.

I have need to prepare more items on Fridays, Sundays, and especially Saturdays. Also, It is better to go with risk-taker approach by preparing more items in the store every day, since we are going to do some serious marketing from now on.

I have need to prepare for rush hours from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., especially 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

I will optimize our bakery sales by making Food \& Beverage dicounts, e.g. for Bread-Tea and Coffee-Cookies combination. Also, we should consider making family packages and discounts.
